GhostWriter Macro - Help
========================

Overview
- This program runs in the system tray and listens for Ctrl+Shift+H.
- It reads text from the most recent Notepad window and types it into the current input field.

How to Run
1. Double-click GhostWriterMacro.exe.
2. Confirm the tray icon appears.
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+H where you want to type.
4. Right-click tray icon -> "프로그램 종료" to exit.

Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended)
- Some systems may require "Run as Administrator" for global hotkey behavior.

What Is Included
- GhostWriterMacro.exe : Main executable
- HELP.txt             : This help file

Troubleshooting
- If Ctrl+Shift+H does not trigger:
  1) Run the executable as Administrator.
  2) Close and restart the app.
  3) Test with tray menu: "지금 실행 (테스트)".
- If it cannot read Notepad text:
  1) Ensure the source window is real Notepad (`notepad.exe`).
  2) Try classic Notepad and Windows 11 Store Notepad separately.
  3) Confirm focus switching is allowed by your security policy.
- If security software blocks execution:
  1) Add app folder to allowlist.
  2) Re-download from your trusted source.

Logging
- Runtime errors are printed with Python logging as `[ERROR] ...`.

Distribution Tip
- Share the entire folder output from dist\GhostWriterMacro\.
- Do not send only the .exe without required bundled files.
